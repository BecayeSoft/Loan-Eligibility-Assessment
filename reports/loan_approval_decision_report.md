## Model Decision

Based on the machine learning model's predictions, it has determined that the loan application is eligible for approval with a probability of 77%.

Now let's analyze the impact of each feature on the model's decision:

1. Dependents: The number of dependents that the applicant has. A negative SHAP value (-0.04) indicates that having more dependents has a slightly negative effect on the approval decision.

2. ApplicantIncome: The income of the applicant. A positive SHAP value (0.11) indicates that higher income has a positive impact on the approval decision.

3. CoapplicantIncome: The income of the co-applicant. A negative SHAP value (-0.25) suggests that a higher co-applicant income has a negative effect on the approval decision.

4. LoanAmount: The amount of the loan requested. A positive SHAP value (0.03) suggests that a larger loan amount has a slightly positive impact on the approval decision.

5. Loan_Amount_Term: The term of the loan in months. A negative SHAP value (-0.007) suggests that a longer loan term has a slightly negative effect on the approval decision.

6. Gender_Male: Indicates whether the applicant is male. A negative SHAP value (-0.04) suggests that being a male has a slightly negative effect on the approval decision.

7. Married_Yes: Indicates whether the applicant is married. A positive SHAP value (0.16) indicates that being married has a positive impact on the approval decision.

8. Education_Not Graduate: Indicates whether the applicant is a graduate. A positive SHAP value (0.12) suggests that being a non-graduate has a positive impact on the approval decision.

9. Self_Employed_Yes: Indicates whether the applicant is self-employed. A positive SHAP value (0.02) suggests that being self-employed has a small positive impact on the approval decision.

10. Property_Area_Rural: Indicates whether the property is in a rural area. A positive SHAP value (0.11) suggests that having a rural property has a positive impact on the approval decision.

11. Property_Area_Semiurban: Indicates whether the property is in a semi-urban area. A negative SHAP value (-0.12) suggests that having a semi-urban property has a slightly negative effect on the approval decision.

12. Property_Area_Urban: Indicates whether the property is in an urban area. A negative SHAP value (-0.07) suggests that having an urban property has a slightly negative effect on the approval decision.

13. Credit_History_1.0: Indicates whether the applicant has a credit history. A positive SHAP value (0.55) suggests that having a credit history has a strong positive impact on the approval decision.

From the analysis of the SHAP values, it is observed that the most influential features on the model's decision are:
- Credit_History_1.0: Having a credit history is the most influential feature in determining the approval decision. It strongly contributes to an increased probability of approval.
- ApplicantIncome: Higher income positively impacts the approval decision.
- Married_Yes: Being married also has a positive impact on the approval decision.

On the other hand, the following features slightly reduce the probability of approval:
- CoapplicantIncome: Higher co-applicant income negatively affects the approval decision.
- Loan_Amount_Term: Longer loan terms have a slight negative impact on the approval decision.
- Property_Area_Semiurban: Having a property in a semi-urban area slightly reduces the probability of approval.

It is important to note that these SHAP values indicate the relative importance and effect of each feature on the model's decision. Each feature contributes differently to the final decision, and the model takes into account various factors to make its prediction.
