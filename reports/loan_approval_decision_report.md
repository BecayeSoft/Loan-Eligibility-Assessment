## Model Decision

Your loan application has been approved. Several factors contributed to this decision.

### What you did well
- **Income**: You have an income of $5,720. This factor significantly boosts your chances of approval as a higher income increases the likelihood of getting the loan approved.
- **Credit History:** You have a credit history, which is required for loan approval.
- **Requested Loan Amount:** Your loan request of $110,000 falls within the lower range of our allowable amount, which spans from $9,000 to $700,000. This contributed positively to the approval decision.

### What you need to work on
- **Loan Term Duration:** The chosen loan term of 360 months (30 years) exceeds the midpoint in our range of 12 to 480 months. Opting for a longer loan term slightly diminishes your chances of approval.

To improve your chances of approval in the future:
- Opt for a shorter loan term, as longer loan terms slightly reduce the likelihood of approval. Consider choosing a term closer to the midpoint of our allowable range.
- Continue to maintain a good credit history, as it positively impacts the approval decision.
- Increase your income if possible, as higher incomes increase the likelihood of loan approval.
