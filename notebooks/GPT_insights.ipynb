      "3. CoapplicantIncome: This feature represents the income of the co-applicant, if applicable. In your case, the co-applicant's income is $2,015.

      "\n",
      "7. Self_Employed_Yes: This feature indicates if you are self-employed (1) or not (0). The system considers this feature and finds that being self-employed has a positive impact on the approval decision. It implies that being self-employed slightly increases the chances of approval.\n",

      "8. Property_Area_Rural, Property_Area_Semiurban, Property_Area_Urban: These features represent the property's location and indicate whether it is in a rural, semiurban, or urban area.

It suggests that having the property in a semiurban area greatly increases the chances of approval.\n",
